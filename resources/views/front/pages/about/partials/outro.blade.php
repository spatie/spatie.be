                    We design, build and support websites, webshops and applications —since 2004.

                    We prefer analysis, clear-cut advice and solid technology over momentary fads. Our sites are built with modern standards, and optimized for performance on all types of devices.

                    Almost every aspect of our job builds upon the work of others.
                    We greatly value open source and try to give back to the community whenever possible.

                    There is a strong mentality to stay on top of things: through Slack, in-house presentations or conferences.
                    A part of our workload is dedicated to open source and side projects.
                    You can spot team members in user groups or as conference speakers as well.

                ‘Spatie’ is Dutch for ‘space’, the character between 2 words.
                <br>You pronounce it /'spɑːsiː/.

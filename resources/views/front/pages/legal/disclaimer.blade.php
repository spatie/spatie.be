                    <h2>Our website</h2>
                    <h3>Good operation, safety and accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can rest assured, we offer an easy-to-use website that is safe for each User. We take all
                        reasonable measures necessary to ensure the proper operation, safety and accessibility of our
                        website.
                        However, we can give you no absolute guarantees, and you must regard our measures as an
                        obligation of means.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any use of the website is always at your own risk. This means that we carry no liability for
                        damages resulting from malfunctions, interruptions, defects or harmful elements to the website,
                        regardless of the existence of a strange cause or force majeure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have the right to limit access to our website at any time and/or to suspend it in whole or in
                        part, without prior warning. We do this in principle only where the circumstances justify this,
                        but this is not an absolute condition.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Site content</h3>
                    <p>
                        The content of the website is largely determined by us and we take great care in this content.
                        This means that we take the necessary measures to ensure that our website is as complete,
                        accurate and up to date as possible, even when the content is provided by third parties. The
                        content on our website can always be amended, supplemented or deleted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we can give no guarantees about the quality of the information on our website. It is
                        possible that the information is not complete, sufficiently accurate and/or useful. We are
                        therefore not liable for (direct and indirect) damage the User suffers as a result of the
                        information on our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case certain content on our website is a violation of applicable law and/or a violation of
                        the rights of third parties and/or simply is unacceptable, we ask you to report this to us as
                        soon as possible so that we can take appropriate measures. So that we can proceed to a partial
                        or entire removal and/or adaptation of the content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our website contains content that can be downloaded. Each download of our website is always at
                        your own risk. We are not liable and damage as a result of a loss of data or damage to the
                        computer system is the sole responsibility of the User.

                        Rates specifically but also other information about products on the website are subject to a
                        reservation of manifest programming and typing errors. The User cannot claim for any such errors
                        on the basis of the agreement with SPATIE.

                    <h3>What we expect from you as a User</h3>
                    <p>
                        The User also bears a certain responsibility when using our website. The User should always
                        refrain from actions which may have a harmful impact on the proper functioning and security of
                        the website. As such our website may not be used to circumvent our business model and/or to
                        collect information from other Users on a large scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is therefore not allowed to use our website for the distribution of content that can cause
                        damage to other Users of the website, such as the spreading of malicious software such as
                        computer viruses, malware, worms, Trojans and cancel bots. The distribution of unsolicited
                        and/or commercial messages via the website, such as chain letters, junk email, spamming is also
                        included in this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to take all the necessary actions that can produce recovery for us and for
                        our Users, both at the judicial and extrajudicial level. The User is personally and solely
                        responsible if his actions and behaviour can cause effective damage to the website and other
                        Users. In that case he must hold SPATIE harmless from any damage claim that follows.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
                    <p>
                        The content of our website can contain a link, hyperlink or framed link to external websites or
                        other forms of electronic portals. A link does not automatically mean that there is a link
                        between us and the external website, nor that we (implicitly) agree with the content of these
                        websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We keep no check on these external websites and are not responsible for the safe and correct
                        operation of the link and the final destination. As soon as you click on the link, you will
                        leave our website and one can no longer hold us liable for any damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible that the external websites do not offer the same guarantees as we do. Therefore,
                        we recommend to read carefully the general terms and conditions and the privacy statement of
                        these websites.

                    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Each User gets a limited right to access, use and display of our web sites and its content. This
                        granted right is non-exclusive, non-transferable and may only be used in a personal,
                        non-commercial context. We ask our Users not to use and/or to make changes to the rights
                        protected business, without the consent of the beneficiary. SPATIE attaches great importance to
                        its intellectual property rights and has taken all possible measures to ensure the protection.
                        Any breach of the existing intellectual property rights will be pursued.

                    <h2>General provisions concerning the general terms and conditions</h2>
                    <p>
                        We retain the freedom to make changes to our website and related services at any time, to
                        expand, limit or stop them. This can be done without prior notification of the User and neither
                        gives rise to any form of compensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These general terms and conditions (including the terms and conditions of sale) are exclusively
                        governed by and interpreted in accordance with Belgian law. All disputes relating to or arising
                        from offers of SPATIE, or agreements that are concluded with it shall be submitted to the
                        competent court of the judicial district of Antwerp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the operation or validity of one or more of the above provisions of these general terms and
                        conditions will be in jeopardy, this will have no effect on the validity of the remaining
                        provisions of this agreement. In such case we have the right to change the provision concerned
                        with a valid provision of similar effect.

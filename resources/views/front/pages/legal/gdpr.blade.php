                            the purposes set forth in this Processors Agreement. The Processor will not process the

                            European Union or the law of a Member State that applies to it, the Processor must report
                            this to Controller prior to the Processing, unless the law concerned forbids such
                            notification on the basis of important reasons of the general interest.

                            agreement. As soon as the task is executed, the Processor brings within a reasonable time,
                            unless explicitly agreed otherwise, an end to any other use of the Personal Data beyond what
                            is necessary in order to enable the Controller to recuperate the data that were entrusted to

                            (including profiling). In the event that a Data Subject makes such a request with the
                            Processor, the Processor will forward the request to the Controller, and the Controller will
                            further deal with the request, unless explicitly agreed otherwise.

                            Controller to answer requests from the Supervisory Authority. For the implementation of such
                            requests, the Parties can agree to link a compensation arrangement to this.

                            technology, changes have to be made to the technology used, the Processor will notify the
                            Controller of this and estimate the necessary costs for this. If the Controller does not

                            At the end of the Processors Agreement, the Processor will provide the Controller all
                            Personal Data that were processed. In addition, he shall provide all information and
                            documentation necessary for the later Processing of Personal Data. After all the Personal
                            Data are passed to the Controller, the Processor immediately terminates the processing and
                            he destroys any copy or back-up that he still possesses. Any costs associated with the
                            return of the Personal Data and the destruction of them are at the expense of the
                            Controller.

                            The nullity or invalidity of a provision or part of a provision of this agreement does not
                            affect the operation and validity of the remaining provisions. The Parties will in that case
                            make all efforts to replace or adjust the provision in question to the extent necessary to
                            make this provision valid and enforceable. In that case the Parties will negotiate in good
                            faith and will strive for an adjustment in order that the original intent of the provision
                            remains unaffected as much as possible. If this proves impossible will only that provision
                            be considered as non-existing.

                            This agreement is governed by Belgian law. In the event of any dispute concerning the
                            implementation of this agreement, the Parties are expected to make all efforts to find and
                            amicable solution. The Parties will draw up a reasonable interpretation of this Agreement.
                            In the absence of an amicable solution, the dispute can be submitted to a centre of
                            arbitration and mediation (such as CEPANI) or a competent court. The exclusive competent
                            court is the court of the judicial district of Antwerp, being the district in which the
                            registered office of the Processor is located.

                            Parties may, for the execution of the work agree on a fixed price. Fixed prices are

                            will be increased by 10%, with a minimum of €50, in title of a lumpsum established and

                            state what amount and invoice components are disputed. The non-disputed amounts
                            must always be paid within the terms of payment of the invoice.

                            If it is agreed that the work will take place in phases, SPATIE can delay the start of the
                            services belonging to a following phase, until the client has approved the results of the

                            for an indefinite time and this brings about additional costs, these will always be at the

                            If the client wishes to change or expand the task given in the agreement, this can only take

                            SPATIE will notify the client as soon as possible when a change by an intermediate party,

                            If a fixed price was agreed for the work, SPATIE will inform the client in advance if the to

                            will be exceeded. Unless an objection is submitted in writing, the client will be presumed
                            to have agreed with the additional work.

                            Necessity or desirability of additional work can never be a reason to dissolve the

                            Any time limits when ordering or placing the tasks will run from the working day following
                            the issue of the necessary documents or from the signature of the agreement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The agreed delivery period is prolonged to the extent that the client, when issuing the
                            documents, drawings, pictures, models, photographs, texts, and so on, as well as when
                            returning corrected tests or delaying meetings, has remained in default.

                            If exceeding the time limit (of delivery) takes place, SPATIE will notify the client as soon

                            possible.

                            Because the delivery time can be affected by actions of third parties and cases of force
                            majeure, they are not regarded as explicit commitment. Late delivery may, subject to
                            conflicting clause, not give rise to refusal of the delivery and will not give rise to any
                            compensation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Exceeding of the time limit will never give the client the right to dissolution and/or

                            from this article 9.

                            <p>In the case of chargeable shortcoming in the performance of the contract, SPATIE is only
                                liable for replacement compensation, i.e. compensation for the value of the performance,
                                remaining in arrears, or (partial) refund of the price received for the non-conforming
                                part of the assignment. Any liability of SPATIE for any other form of damage is

                                damage or consequential loss or damage due to lost profits. SPATIE is in no way liable
                                for delay damages, damages for loss of data, damage due to exceeding the delivery
                                deadline due to changed circumstances, damage as a result of the acquiring of inadequate
                                cooperation, information or materials by the client, and the damage as a result of

                                written agreement. Defects in the materials that were stored by SPATIE, will not
                                compromise its responsibility and cannot cause a demand on damage-compensation.

                            name needs is simply and only to be considered as an additional client service. The client

                            maintaining or cancelling a domain name, in particular with regards the regulation which is
                            handled by ICANN, OpenSRS, DNS BE or any other relevant authority. SPATIE will in no way be
                            held liable if the client loses control of the domain name as a result of such regulations
                            or any other reason. SPATIE will for that matter always seek to defend the interests of the
                            client.

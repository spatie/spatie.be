## Handling feedback

During the lifetime of a package, many users will likely have feedback. This feedback can be split up into three big categories:

- bug reports: these are reports of, ideally reproducible, bugs that we need to fix
- general questions: this feedback revolves around how the package can be used
- feature requests: these are things our code doesn't do but could do.

On GitHub, we use an [issue template](https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel) to triage feedback into the above categories.

This is how it looks like when a new issue is created on a repo.

For general questions, a new discussion in the "Q&A" category will be open. Feature requests will go into a discussion in the "Ideas" category. For bugs, a new issue will be opened.

We consider ourselves the owner of the issue tracker. The issues list on a repo should only contain items that we intend to work on. If a user created an issue that we don't want to invest our time in, it should be converted to a discussion.

The community owns the discussions of a repo. We'll give feedback on specific discussions when we have the time, but there's no guarantee.
